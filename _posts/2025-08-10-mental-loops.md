# Mental Loops

I've gotten quite interested in how the human mind works. I've discovered last year that my brain will continuously repeat certain simulations of actions or conditions. I call these Mental Loops.

Physical examples include rowing(both sweep and scull), pool shots, and swimming. For rowing, it's probably because it really matters to me (high significance) and I'm excited about it so the brain wants to prepare myself for delivering the best technique. For pool, it's even more interesting. Not only that it will simulate my cue movement, it'll also "predict" the trajectory of both balls. I think I was playing it so much that my brain can keep reinforcing the simulation.

With my limited knowledge of the brain, I'll try and explain why - our brain has the amazing property of being able to model the world and construct accurate ideas of how the world behaves. Anywhere, any time, our brains are modeling. For instance we can imagine and predict how a feather floats down. We can imagine how much heavier a sumo wrestler is compared to a normal person. We can also tell whether the way I'm aiming at the ball that I can make the shot. This is what many forms of learning is.

**I haven't figured out why this happens for pool, but not for my physics exams though.**

Another way this can occur is the form of conditions. I used to watch these youtube challenge videos like "The Floor is Lava" where participants must avoid touching the floor. After watching that video, my brain is accustomed to the mode that "people in the video must not touch floor" even when I switch to another video, and gets used to it after a while.

I think the real question is how I can make use of this. Ideally I do want my brain to simulate things like this, or like a physics prof likes to say, leave them in the backrooms of the mind.
