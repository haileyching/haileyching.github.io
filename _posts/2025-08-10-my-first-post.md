# Hello!
This is just a quick article to introduce what this is for. I am trying to keep up the habit of writing prompts and diaries. Ideally, weekly,  I'll choose the most interesting ones and share them here. (Really, I should write them up in Obsidian first, because it's also MarkDown.)

make a procedure for this. include in the week routine.
