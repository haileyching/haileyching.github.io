## Introduction

I‚Äôm a phys natsci who just finished NSTIB exams (Physics A&B, Maths). Many comments I‚Äôll make below are very specific to these subjects. My results are decent and not the best, but I think it might be interesting to reflect on my preparations for the exams.

## Personal experience

#### Easter holiday

I started revising around the second to third week of the easter holiday, I think it is a relative early start as I‚Äôve had a decent amount of break after Lent Term (i also got sick right at the end‚Ä¶) I tried to formulate a plan for the revision. I decided that I'll attempt a full year of all 6 papers first. (3 subjects x 2 papers per subject)

| > üï≥Ô∏è Pitfall 1: Syllabus Changes<br>> For physics A and B papers, there has been a few recent format changes<br>> 1. IDK - 2011: fairly old format. Might not worth going that far back <br>> 2. 2012 - 2019: This swapped the content in paper 1 and 2. This content split between papers is consistent from there on. <br>> 3. 2020: COVID. So a lot of questions are copied directly from past papers. Also there is only one merged math paper.<br>> 4. 2021 - present: They removed the choice of questions. Before 2020, students could choose like 2 out of 4 questions in each section I think. |

Pitfall 1 means I shouldn‚Äôt have started with the 2011 set of papers‚Ä¶ which I did. But not too big of a deal, just make sure you know the content splits between papers in the present day.

  
  

|                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| ##### ‚ÑπÔ∏èInformation 1: Content Splits between papers<br><br>  <br><br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|PhyA P1\|QM, ExptM<br><br>QM essay\|<br>\|PhyA P2\|OWO, TCM<br><br>OWO/TCM essay\|<br>\|PhyB P1\|EM, Classical\|<br>\|PhyB P2\|EM, Classical, Thermo<br><br>EM, Classical essay 1 each\|<br>\|Math P1\|Curvilinear, PDE, Greens, Fourier Transform, 2 Matrix Q, Complex Analysis, Series Solution, Functionals, Rayleigh-Ritz\|<br>\|Math P2\|Sturm-Liouville, PDE(laplace), 3D Green's, Contour, Transform Methods, Tensor, NormalModes, 2 groups, Representation theory\|<br><br>But be careful: Bob told me that in Math sometimes they swap certain questions in P1 and P2, e.g. Sturm Liouville and Rayleigh-Ritz |

  

Doing past papers took surprisingly long. The attempt itself takes 3 hours. When starting out I get a lot of them wrong, so it might take another 3 hours to mark thoroughly. But also that I was quite slow and casual so I spent pretty much the whole easter holiday just doing that and some assigned supo work. I also felt a really strong mental resistance from marking the paper‚Ä¶

  

Just a note: I realized that a lot of the marks in PhyA Quantum (Paper 1) can be obtained by reverse engineering or computing the answers instead of tricky problem solving, and quickly realized that this would be the easier paper for me‚Ä¶

  

I planned some other tasks for the easter holiday like pre learning content in Easter Term and catching up content in previous terms but just failed to, because doing the papers took too long‚Ä¶ also note that I skipped the Easter Term content in doing the past papers‚Ä¶ quite a pitfall too, cuz I never realized how little practice I had on them.

#### Easter Term

There are about 3 more weeks of lectures, and all of these content are examined. These 3 weeks I decided that I‚Äôll prioritize doing past papers over doing new supo work. Not that the supervisors were very pleased.

  

I attended most of the PhyA and Math lectures , but didn‚Äôt pay any attention in math because the lecturer talks really really really slow‚Ä¶ for phyA I did try to pay attention, but the 2 friends next to me in the lecture never seemed to do that‚Ä¶

  
  

|   |
|---|
|##### üï≥Ô∏èPitfall 2: Easter Term Lectures<br><br>- There are ‚ÄòBrief notes‚Äô and ‚Äòessay‚Äô questions in PhyA and PhyB, which could ask you to explain what you know about a specific knowledge point<br>    <br>- Try and really lock in in the lectures. I made the mistake of thinking that ‚ÄúI‚Äôll properly go over it later‚Äù. This close to the exam, learning can and should be treated as revision because there's not much time to actually revise it‚Ä¶|

  

Somehow in term time my lifestyle was much healthier than in the holidays. Wake in the morning, do one past paper (even days)/ mark one PP (odd days). Waking and sleeping early, get some sunlight in the morning, get 5 hugs every day, read unrelated books, studying with friends definitely helped.

  

#### Lectures end

There were 10 days before the first exam (still have supo but I didnt care). Around the last 7 days I fully devotes them to doing the first two papers (A1 and M1), while strategically listing the breakdown of papers (which I‚Äôll explain later. I shouldve dont it much earlier)

  

|   |
|---|
|##### üï≥Ô∏èPitfall 3: Misallocation of revision<br><br>- I messed up - out of the fear of exams and a sudden surge of perfectionism (perhaps to avoid the subjects I‚Äôm worse at) I spent all those 7 days on the first 2 exams. They also happen to be the easiest. Not that 7 days is ‚Äútoo much‚Äù revision or those 2 exams, but that I shouldve used some of them to revise stuff that I‚Äôm so bad at (physics B P1 and P2).¬†<br>    <br><br>More time should be spent on hard papers, not easy papers.|

  

I started feeling more stressed around 7 days and 3 days to exams. I can feel myself stressed physiologically, like heart pounding and eating too quickly. Not ideal. Talking to friends in college helped a lot, people are very supportive.¬†

  

- Bad dress rehearsal, good show (for bad practice papers lol)
    
- In the grand scheme of things these exams is just 1 month in the whole 3 year degree
    

  

Every day I had a decent routine, me and my friend wake each other up and sync up our schedules of the day as much as possible. Revising in the common room. It was kinda annoying if other people were talking in the common room. But it‚Äôs a common room after all. I was averaging around 5 hours per day.

  

And for the day right before the first exam, I know I was gonna procrastinate anyway so I might as well reserve it for not studying. I did end up studying and procrastinating but because I know the expectations are 0 so anything I did was extra.

  

Also note that when you're kinda stressed but not really in the actual exam you might mess up the algebra or make careless shit. That‚Äôs fine! Don‚Äôt let it frick your mental state up. Believe firmly that when you're in the exams these carelesses will be gone.¬†

  

#### Exam period

|##### ‚ÑπÔ∏èInformation 2: Exam period (2025)<br><br>  <br><br>\|   \|   \|<br>\|---\|---\|<br>\|Jun 2\|Monday 02 Jun 09.00-12.00 MTH/1 Mathematics (Paper 1) Sports Hall, Cambridge Sports Centre\|<br>\|Jun 3\|Tuesday 03 Jun 13.30-16.30 PSA/1 Physics A (Paper 1) Department of Physics, Ray Dolby Centre\|<br>\|Jun 4\|<br>\|Jun 5\|<br>\|Jun 6\|<br>\|Jun 7\|Saturday 07 Jun 09.00-12.00 PSB/1 Physics B (Paper 1) Sports Hall, Cambridge Sports Centre\|<br>\|Jun 8\|<br>\|Jun 9\|<br>\|Jun 10\|<br>\|Jun 11\|Wednesday 11 Jun 13.30-16.30 PSA/2 Physics A (Paper 2) Department of Physics, Ray Dolby Centre\|<br>\|Jun 12\|<br>\|Jun 13\|Friday 13 Jun 13.30-16.30 PSB/2 Physics B (Paper 2) Faculty of Law\|<br>\|Jun 14\|<br>\|Jun 15\|<br>\|Jun 16\|<br>\|Jun 17\|Tuesday 17 Jun 09.00-12.00 MTH/2 Mathematics (Paper 2) Exam Hall, Student Services Centre, New Museums Site\|<br><br>  <br><br>Many 3 day breaks‚Ä¶ do not be deceived into thinking that you can revise a lot there.|

  
  

|   |
|---|
|##### üï≥Ô∏èPitfall 4: Misjudgement of breaks<br><br>DO NOT be fooled into thinking that you can learn or revise a lot of content in those 3 days. Realized this only in the break before B1, and it was too late.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>These 3 days should be used for reviewing and short term memorization of what you definitely need to know/short notes stuff.|

  
  

|   |
|---|
|##### üï≥Ô∏èPitfall 5: Unrealistic schedules<br><br>On one of the days before B1 I did a screening of 10 years of B1 past papers and set an ambitious plan (8 hours) for the next day to go through all content in classical mechanics. That failed. In the first 3 hours starting 7AM I was locked in but after that I just felt so sleepy. Like doing rowing ergs, go at 90% of your MAX, not actually 100% MAX MAX. Otherwise burnout is imminent.|

  
  

Around the last two exams I really couldn‚Äôt care about the exams that much because we were making huge progress in rowing and getting on the bumps races lol

  

For your reference, this is how I found each exam paper:

SPOILER ALERT!

|   |   |   |   |
|---|---|---|---|
|M1|V. easy|Sufficient preparation|We knew it will be easy because 2024 paper was horrendous. For instance look at Q1 of 2024 and 2025. Because 2024 Q1 was so impossible, they made 2025 Q1 too easy lol<br><br>  <br><br>I felt that I managed to get near full marks on a few questions so I felt pretty confident.|
|A1|easy|Sufficient preparation|My friend came out of the exam saying that it was too easy. I told him he shouldn‚Äôt say that so arrogantly but I also found it quite easy. Then he said ‚Äúeven you found it easy, goes to show how damn easy the paper was‚Äù. That fricking bastard lmao.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>Generally it was fine. The indistinguishability stuff we happen to have gone through the day before (refer to 2023 A1, which was quite hard)<br><br>  <br><br>The experimental methods long Q was quite surprising because it was usually either Op-Amps or Chi-Squared. But for us it was a mix of various things. So I think I missed quite a lot of marks there, but I hope my other questions can make up for it.|
|B1|HARD|Insufficient‚Ä¶|Everyone came out of the exam hall looking defeated. For long questions, there was a mass spring system horizontally attached and it oscillates vertically as well. Then we attach a pendulum and look for normal modes using lagrangian. Somehow very little people worked it out. I couldnt and I thought lagrangian was easy‚Ä¶<br><br>  <br><br>There was also rotation stuff, and weird square wave polarization. idkkkk<br><br>  <br><br>The bookwork was worth very little marks in this exam. It was tricky.|
|A2|medium|50% sufficient|I predicted correctly that the long question was on semiconductors, but couldn't get myself to do a practice question. I think I did it alright but would have bagged more marks if I had practiced. Cuz I think I just spent one to two full days working on just condensed matter (new content not familiar)|
|B2|HARD|Insufficient‚Ä¶|ARUGH the questions were just different from previous years. For example multi stage carnot cycles which I have no idea‚Ä¶<br><br>  <br><br>And some basic derivation I forgot to memorize, like proving the heat capacity under constant stuff.<br><br>  <br><br>And classical mechanics short notes I just didn‚Äôt know the content well enough.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>And EMAG magnetic potential i didnt know.<br><br>  <br><br>But it was the [Getting On Race](https://www.cucbc.org/mays/gor) right after that so I didn‚Äôt talk to anyone about this paper.|
|M2|medium|50% sufficient|I couldnt do the 3D greens but it wasnt so hard‚Ä¶ so skill issue. Lack of practice. Others are generally Fine maybe avg 14/20.¬†<br><br>  <br><br>Groups was definitely a problem. ‚ÄúA gloop is indeed a group‚Äù I was gonna do Q8 and optionally Q9 but because the normal modes question had a triangle and looked intimidating I decided to go for Q9 which I didn't revise much.<br><br>  <br><br>Definitely need leave myself some choice next time.|

  

Indeed you can see the correlation between difficulty and how sufficient my preparations were. But how prepared I feel depends on how hard the paper was, I think. And generally my friends agreed with this difficulty ranking for this year I think.

  
  

I feel that my stamina for intense revision or practice fell off when exam period starts. So, definitely lower expectations for revision in that time. Maybe just set reviewing tasks for those breaks.

  

Minor stuff:

  

- I had a checklist for what I needed to bring. On the day of the last exam I used the checklist, checked and sharpened my pencils, and then FORGOT to bring my pencil case. So always check again when you're out of the door.
    
- No need to worry about the yellow sheet if you‚Äôve forgotten it.¬†
    
- Wear sufficient clothing might be cold
    
- Ask for extra paper early on
    
- Put useless stuff on the floor.
    
- I didn‚Äôt really count the days until our lectures ended. I don‚Äôt know why. Maybe I‚Äôm less stressed that way, or maybe that I genuinely believed that I don‚Äôt need to. TBH I still don‚Äôt think I need to count the days.¬†
    
- I also don‚Äôt like thinking how many days per exams are there until the exam‚Ä¶ its just gonna stress you out lmao. And effectively you wouldn‚Äôt spend the whole day on one single topic right?
    
-   
    

  
  

## Strategies and Tactics and Whether They Worked

- At some point I decided my goal will be NOT be a mid-first. Instead, my goal will be minimizing my time to studying (not effort of studying) but still feel that I can get a borderline first like last year. So I did rowing, went to digital art society, did a sustainability audit volunteering, played lots of pool, went to tithall cold water swimming and brunches. I read a few unrelated books.
    
- My goal is to figure out how to revise for exams efficiently, and maximize my other good experiences in uni and in life.
    
-   
      
    

  

#### Tactics:

- ##### Screening
    

- In IB economics I would use the syllabus to list every possible question they can ask, by topic. I reminded myself that exams are not a test of intelligence, but rather a specific set of skills. So I started what I call a screening process for the papers.
    
- Originally I tried to use a combined text file of past papers and feed it into deepseek, to organize the questions. But at that time the technology is still prone to hallucinations and gaslighting so not great.
    
- Eventually I made a combined PDF file for 2012-2019 and 2020-2024, so I can directly search for keywords or question numbers for certain topics.
    

- For example for complex analysis I would search ‚ÄúCauchy‚Äù. Not all the questions will come up, but still useful
    
- For math, the topics almost always correspond to the same question numbers every year.
    

- Improvement: Do the screening by paper, not by subject. You can then identify which topics below to which papers. This makes it easier to know what you need to short term memorize for each paper.
    
- My Screening:¬† [EASTER 2025 MASTERPLAN NSTIB](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MqRccNkKw-57wTSohQK_oEyz7QUE3pFI4ROXKz4R0Ws/edit?usp=sharing)¬†
    
- For example for PhyA and B, I listed for each topic:¬†
    

- Stuff worth doing/looking
    
- Essay
    
- Brief Notes
    
- ShortQ tasks
    
- LongQ Subtasks
    
- Definitions
    
- Derivations
    

- Please do this as early as you can even if you don‚Äôt know the content that well. Otherwise you'll be setting up unrealistic expectations for what to revise too close to the exam
    

- ##### Error book
    

- After marking the paper, log them in a table.¬†
    

- (Subject Year Paper Status)
    

- For error book also see the same sheet.
    

- Subject/Topic Source Q Q error Takeaway Further action required
    
- Improvement: Q error and Takeaway is redundant, can combine into the same.
    

- Important: Export into anki for reviewing. This worked well.
    

- Copy them into 3 columns, then download as TSV (Tab Separated Values file) not CSV¬†
    
- Import into anki easily
    

- It‚Äôs a little time consuming but this definitely helps reminding me from making the exact same mistakes
    
- Did I really read the question and guess what mistake I made, when I‚Äôm reviewing? No. I most likely just spammed space bar, but I think it‚Äôs still slightly better than just reading them off the table. Space repetition helps.
    
- IMPROVEMENT: don‚Äôt write them all in the same table. Cuz I just end up skipping for the most urgent topic in the anki a bit annoying
    

- ##### Reducing Careless mistakes
    

- I think I tried to list them but eventually stopped doing that. Too many lists to keep track of üò≠
    
- But it‚Äôs definitely useful to know your strengths and weaknesses in this area.
    
- My weaknesses:
    

- Sign errors
    

- EVERYWHERE. So I‚Äôm still trying to do that
    
- Advanced sign error: probably when doing complex stuff the powers of i.
    
- For example I try to address sign errors in determinants by writing out 0s even when I think the answer is obvious.¬†
    

- Lost terms
    

- From going from line to line
    

- Addressed this by underlying the terms I‚Äôm working on, so that I don‚Äôt miss any of the factor
    

- From taking a result
    
- From pre-factor of integral
    

- Characters deformed
    

- Bad handwriting but I think this has improved recently
    

- Let me list some common sense stuff down here‚Ä¶
    

- I often feel paranoid that I got something wrong and end up realizing the error after working a while with the paranoia
    
- Error carry forward: For questions like Greens functions, if you make a small mistake early on, the rest of your answers are essentially void.
    
- Try to reverse engineer possible careless mistakes. For example if you are off by a factor from a ‚Äúshow that‚Äù question, hunt for where you might have lost that factor.¬†
    

- Improvement: Definitely try to improve my clarity of working and maintain good habits, even when there is time pressure.
    

- ##### Marking past papers
    

- Hmm, this year we still have Bob‚Äôs Worked Answers for all of these subjects.
    
- He‚Äôs probably correct 70%, wrong 15% and confusing 15% of the time.
    
- If he fails, use chatgpt/deepseek.¬†
    

- This might change quickly but at that time the capability of chatgpt free and deepseek were similar for problem solving. But deepseek has unlimited usage
    

- ##### Summary sheet
    

- In condensed matter we have a summary sheet given by the lecturer, containing things we need to know¬† (not everything we need to know)
    
- I found it helpful to look at it and see what derivation do I not understand
    
- For other papers it‚Äôs definitely useful to make one summary sheet for the sake of reminding myself. Make this early on too - a good way to go through the content again.
    
- I really liked the style of the condensed matter summary sheet cuz lots of diagrams and neat derivations + results. This can be done easily by hand but hard to do on latex. I‚Äôm not familiar with latex anyway
    

- ##### Improving focus
    

- The very very first condition of focusing well is sleeping well, which I think I did most days.
    
- MUSIC: Music is fine, switching music every one minute is not. More often than not I find myself going to youtube and searching for another music in the middle of some music. So probably just choose one long soundtrack to listen to. This is still something I‚Äôm struggling with in the middle of writing this very document
    
- There were a few days which I think I reached a really good level of focus. Some other conditions I noticed:
    

- Pretending to focus because of some people around me. If they are focused, I‚Äôm pressured to focus. If they‚Äôre not, I‚Äôll want to act focused in front of them. Either way I can focus better. But if I know them very well already then I don't really care, which is kinda bad.
    
- Clearly defined task: for example a paper, or a question which I‚Äôve already picked a while ago.¬†
    
- Not too long of a session.
    

- I didn‚Äôt use instagram or other social media much.¬†
    

## Improvements/Advice/Takeaways

- Screening is good
    
- Can probably interleaf topics for the revision of content and practicing the by topic question if there's enough time.
    
- Can probably think how to use supo work to revise better? Especially the case for classical mechanics.
    
- Discuss content with friends as much as possible.
    

- I realised that I don‚Äôt really care about details, so this might be a good way to ensure that I do know the details that I need if they ask me
    
- I don‚Äôt like to butt in if two people are already discussing something I have no idea about cuz I‚Äôm gonna have too much to ask to understand
    

- Go hunt for the more ideal state of focus! Re-create the conditions. This will be useful lifelong
    
- Improvement: Do the screening by paper, not by subject. You can then identify which topics below to which papers. This makes it easier to know what you need to short term memorize for each paper.
    
- Improvement: Q error and Takeaway is redundant, can combine into the same.
    
- IMPROVEMENT: don‚Äôt write them all in the same table. Cuz I just end up skipping for the most urgent topic in the anki a bit annoying
    
- Improvement: Definitely try to improve my clarity of working and maintain good habits, even when there is time pressure.
    
- USE TEXTBOOKS! I realised only one day before my last exam that the riley hobson bence book for math is actually amazing. (Mathematical Methods for Physics and Engineering: A Comprehensive Guide Michael Paul Hobson) Good explanations, diagrams, questions‚Ä¶
    
- Avoid those pitfalls
    
- Get to know your strengths and weaknesses, especially relative to each paper. Know the papers well. If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. Áü•ÂΩºÁü•Â∑±ÔºåÁôæÊàò‰∏çÊÆÜ
    
- Extras: how I would have done it if I start NSTIB over. This is very personal and only for reference, and how I might prepare for part II
    

- Sleep well. Maintain a good routine
    
- 2024 Summer Vacation
    

- Get to know the structure of the year. Can already do the screening process to know what knowledge there is, and the splits between papers.
    
- Don‚Äôt slack off! Set up a routine, use the tips and conditions for focus.¬†
    
- In retrospect I would have worked on¬†
    

- classical mechanics questions, just because it‚Äôs surprisingly hard but it‚Äôs relatively easy to self learn in advance.¬†
    

- Morin is a nice textbook even though one of my friend disagrees. But I think its level of difficulty matches the course
    

- Math: Drill the contour integrals cuz it‚Äôs kinda fun to drill questions like that. Learn easter stuff if I can (indeed groups is basically independent of other topics taught in NSTIB so I can totally self learn it) self learn using the textbook.
    
- Easter stuff, including its supo work.
    

-   
    

- Michaelmas Term
    

- Well‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt spend THAT long on supo work. This year, our supervisor Songyuan told us he'd prefer perfectly answered attempts to 2 questions than mediocre answers to 6 questions, so to build the habit of excellence.
    
- I think he‚Äôs right. For supo work it is still necessary to strain your brain hard and not treat it like exams. Create the conditions for focus, talk to friends about it.
    
- Maybe create the summary sheet as we go along the term. It will be helpful to the supo work as well.
    
- For me last year I always messed up around week 5 or 6 just stopped going to lectures and stayed in room or stayed up late watching anime‚Ä¶ this is a lifestyle issue and this easter I finally didn‚Äôt mess up like that. But that time the OWO course just felt so impossible lmao, in retrospect it‚Äôs not that bad at all. Don‚Äôt give up in term!¬†
    

- Perhaps if I knew the questions only require like a small portion of the slides I wouldn‚Äôt have.
    
- Maybe the 20/80 rule applies to examinations too
    

- But Realistically I‚Äôm going to miss some content in term time, so catch that up in vacation
    

- Christmas Vacation (around 6 weeks)
    

- Can afford to take a break for 2-3 weeks
    
- Assuming I‚Äôve already done the screening in the summer, these 3 weeks will really be consolidation of the content.¬†
    

- Do so by writing the summary sheet
    
- Write down explicit procedures for stuff. That‚Äôs what I did for like series solutions to ODE or greens functions.
    
- Do the questions by topic, already using the error book. For this case it‚Äôs probably fine to use older papers to avoid spoilers for new papers
    

- Lent Term: similar to michaelmas
    
- Easter Vacation (around 6 weeks)
    

- Can afford to take a break for 2-3 weeks
    
- If screening is done, then I wouldn‚Äôt have done the full year of paper because it takes way too long.¬†
    
- Instead I‚Äôll be sure to cover the content that I missed, cover all the content by writing the summary sheet and procedures. Do questions by topic. (2 weeks) Don‚Äôt worry if I couldnt do full papers yet.
    
- Prioritize learning/revising easter term stuff. If i‚Äôve already learnt them in summer, that would be huge here.
    

- Easter Term
    

- I‚Äôll still do/mark the papers the way I‚Äôve done them, and skip phyB lectures knowing the lectures suck. It‚Äôs important to grind and accumulate experience/knowledge.
    
- If I‚Äôve already done the supo work in summer that would also be so huge.
    
- Allocate time wisely: if I‚Äôm already doing decently well on phyA1 and M1 (like usually getting ~70) then MOVE ON to other papers which I still haven‚Äôt been able to do that.
    
- DO PAST PAPERS FOR EASTER CONTENT!
    

- Lectures end
    

- Depending on how prepared, maybe I‚Äôll spend the last 5 days (including the 0 expectation day) out of the 10 days on the two imminent papers.
    

- Breaks between exams
    

- Use anki to review stuff like errors
    
- Memorize stuff, e.g. the summary sheet!
    

## Final remarks

- As you're in your second year now you‚Äôre quite familiar with how exams work now. I think a good amount of people started locking in in second year, and as the subjects get more specialized, the competition will only get stronger.¬†
    
- After all this document is more for myself than for you readers. But might be quite useful to you too, I wish I‚Äôd get something like this lol¬†
    
- I think giving advice to others = giving advice to myself
